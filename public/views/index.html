        <h3> A little something about me..</h3>
        <h4> I graduated from York University at the end of 2016 with an economics degree. I initially thought this would be my career path till the year 2019.<br>
        A friend told me about the opportunity to be my own business owner in the web development field. He spoke very highly about the entrepreneurship mentality 
        that alot of the workers have and how the ceiling is so high to grow. A component which i felt was missing in my economics field. He introduced me to web 
        developing by showing me how many different websites he made for clients. That got me convinced to learn as fast as i can, Now, i'm officially beginning my 
        education as a full stack developer at York University.</h4>
